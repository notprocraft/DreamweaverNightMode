# DreamweaverNightMode (For Windows)
The Dreamweaver code view can be uncomfortable to look at long periods of time. So here is a more comfortable night look
Go to: Users->[Youre User]->Appdata->Roaming->Adobe->Dreamweaver CC->en_US->Configuration->CodeColoring
Then change the Colors.xml with this NightMode colors (Needs to be named Colors in the folder!!)
